	<h3 id="who-i-am">Who I Am</h3>

	<p>
		Hello! I&#39;m Rubén Ruiz Pedreira, a Web Software Developer with a passion for technology and a
		constant desire to learn. I currently work at Netex Learning, where I implement new features,
		improve existing code, and fix bugs, all while adhering to the principles of Test Driven Design
		and best programming practices. In my spare time, I love working on small projects to explore
		new technologies and bring my innovative ideas to life.
	</p>

	<h3 id="my-journey">My Journey</h3>

	<p>
		My journey in the tech world began at Nemon Intelligence in Business, where I started as a
		Junior Web Software Developer and later transitioned into Quality Management. Currently, I&#39;m
		a part of the team at Netex Learning, and I also undertake freelance projects that allow me to
		apply my skills in diverse contexts.
	</p>

	<h3 id="what-i-do">What I Do</h3>

	<p>
		As a developer, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects. Some of my
		notable freelance work includes a Wallet App for managing cryptocurrency wallets and a CLI
		DevOps application for managing deployed services. At Netex Learning, I&#39;ve contributed to
		the development of SmartED, a platform for managing school tasks and tracking student progress.
	</p>

	<h3 id="my-passions">My Passions</h3>

	<p>
		Beyond development, I&#39;m fascinated by architecture and systems. Thanks to advancements like
		Docker and Kubernetes, these areas have become more accessible to developers. When I&#39;m not
		coding, you&#39;ll likely find me immersed in electronic music, my other great passion.
	</p>

	<h3 id="my-skills">My Skills</h3>

	<p>
		Over the years, I&#39;ve gained proficiency in a range of programming languages and tools.
		I&#39;m skilled in ReactJS, Electron, TypeScript, and Golang, among others. I&#39;m also a
		strong advocate for quality assurance and have experience incorporating end-to-end tests with
		Cypress into the development process.
