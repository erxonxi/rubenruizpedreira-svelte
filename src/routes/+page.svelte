	<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>

	<p>
		Hi, I'm Rubén Ruiz Pedreira, a dedicated Web Software Developer with a deep interest in
		technology and a perpetual thirst for knowledge. I'm currently part of the team at Netex
		Learning, where I enhance the user experience by developing new features, refining existing
		code, and troubleshooting issues. I'm a firm believer in Domain Driven Design and always strive
		to follow best programming practices. When I'm not at work, I enjoy experimenting with new
		technologies and turning my creative ideas into reality through personal projects.
	</p>

	<h3 id="my-career-path">My Career Path</h3>

	<p>
		I embarked on my tech journey at Nemon Intelligence in Business, where I cut my teeth as a
		Junior Web Software Developer before moving into Quality Management. Now, I'm honing my skills
		at Netex Learning and also taking on freelance projects that allow me to explore different
		applications of my expertise.
	</p>

	<h3 id="my-work">My Work</h3>

	<p>
		My career has given me the chance to work on a diverse array of projects. Some of my standout
		freelance contributions include a Wallet App for managing cryptocurrency portfolios and a CLI
		DevOps tool for overseeing deployed services. At Netex Learning, I've played a key role in
		developing SmartED, a comprehensive platform for managing academic tasks and monitoring student
		performance.
	</p>

	<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

	<p>
		Apart from coding, I have a keen interest in architecture and systems, and I'm always excited to
		explore new advancements like Docker and Kubernetes. When I'm not immersed in the tech world,
		you'll probably find me enjoying electronic music, another of my passions.
	</p>

	<h3 id="expertise">Expertise</h3>

	<p>
		I've acquired a broad skill set over the years, mastering various programming languages and
		tools. My expertise includes ReactJS, Electron, TypeScript, and Golang, to name a few. I'm also
		a strong proponent of quality assurance and have integrated end-to-end testing with Cypress into
		my development workflow.
